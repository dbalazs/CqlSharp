    <description>
      CqlSharp is a high performance, asynchronous Cassandra CQL binary protocol client implementing the ADO.NET data provider interfaces.

      It's main features are:
      * The API implements the ADO.NET interfaces. If you are familiar with SqlConnection, SqlCommand, and SqlReader, you should be able to use CqlSharp with no difficulty.
      * CqlSharp is an implementation of the (new) CQL Binary Protocol and therefore requires Cassandra 1.2 and up
      * CqlSharp supports all the binary protocol v2 features: batching, paging, bound query variables, result schema caching, check-and-set (CAS) statements, and sasl-authentication
      * Supports fast mapping of objects to query parameters, or query results to objects. Mapping is tunable by decorating your classes via Table and Column attributes.
      * Query tracing, timeouts and cancellation is supported
      * The API is predominately [asynchronous](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/hh191443.aspx), heavily relying on the System.Threading.Tasks namespace. Synchronous alternatives are available for convenience.
      * Configuration is done through connection strings. The simultaneous use of multiple Cassandra clusters is supported.
      * Extensive logging, including support for custom logger implementations
      
      See https://github.com/reuzel/CqlSharp/wiki/Features for an extensive feature list.

    <releaseNotes>
      ## Version 0.33.0 - Flexibility
      * Removing class, new() constraint on the generic DataReader, allowing structs to be deserialized
      
      ## Version 0.32.2 - Default Guid insertion fix
      * Fixing issue where nill guids were inserted as null values.
      * Adding TimeGuid.Default to get a nill guid with time version flags set.

      ## Version 0.32.1 - Transaction Race fix
      * Fixing race condition issues when using prepared queries in a transaction

      Version 0.32.0 - Decimal support and Fixes
      * Support for decimal types
      * TimeGuid generation rewritten in order to guarantee uniqueness when many TimeGuids are generated within a short timeframe.

    <description>
      CqlSharp is a high performance, asynchronous Cassandra CQL binary protocol client implementing the ADO.NET data provider interfaces.

      It's main features are:
      * The API implements the ADO.NET interfaces. If you are familiar with SqlConnection, SqlCommand, and SqlReader, you should be able to use CqlSharp with no difficulty.
      * CqlSharp is an implementation of the (new) CQL Binary Protocol and therefore requires Cassandra 1.2 and up
      * CqlSharp supports all the binary protocol v2 features: batching, paging, bound query variables, result schema caching, check-and-set (CAS) statements, and sasl-authentication
      * Supports fast mapping of objects to query parameters, or query results to objects. Mapping is tunable by decorating your classes via Table and Column attributes.
      * Query tracing, timeouts and cancellation is supported
      * The API is predominately [asynchronous](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/hh191443.aspx), heavily relying on the System.Threading.Tasks namespace. Synchronous alternatives are available for convenience.
      * Configuration is done through connection strings. The simultaneous use of multiple Cassandra clusters is supported.
      * Extensive logging, including support for custom logger implementations
      
      See https://github.com/reuzel/CqlSharp/wiki/Features for an extensive feature list.

    <releaseNotes>
      ## Version 0.40.0 - Types,types,types
      * Rewrite of type system, CqlType is no longer an enum but a class with subclasses for every Cassandra type
      * Previous CqlType enum is now called CqlTypeCode
      * CqlParameter no longer accepts different CqlTypeCodes, but requires a single CqlType
      * Added high performance very flexible type conversion that prevents boxing, and even converts collection types (e.g. hashset{int} to list{long})
      * Removed explicit references to collection key and value types. They are not used separate from the corresponding CqlTypes anymore
      * Value serialization/deserialization moved to the different CqlType subclasses
      * CqlDataReader.GetDataTypeName(int i) now returns full string representation of the Cassandra type (e.g. map{varchar, int=""})
      * CqlDataReader.GetFieldCqlType added that returns the CqlType used for the given field
      * Removed a lot of boxing/unboxing of primitive types during serialization/deserialization
      
      ## Version 0.37.0 - TraceLogger and Fixes on cluster reconfiguration
      * Fix crash when nodes are added to a running system (and have no tokens gossiped). CqlSharp now reloads configurations every minute until all tokens are found.
      * Fix missing logger binding when using exclusive connection strategy
      * Simplified logger classes and added TraceLogger (thanks to justmara)

      ## Version 0.36.0 - Fixes and Development support
      * Fixing situation where queries using a pagesize are ended with a data frame with no contents
      * Fix of protocol negotiation flow for older Cassandra versions
      * Exposing supported CQL version from CqlConnection
      * Allowing the primary CQL* classes to be subclassed (e.g. allowing them to be mocked)
      * Introducing a non-generic interface to ObjectAccessor{T}
      
      ...
